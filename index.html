                    <p>
                        Our journey began in early 2021, and from the very start, it felt like something truly special.
                        From our first date at a little Japanese restaurant to years filled with travel, non-stop
                        laughs, endless adventures, way too much good food, and heaps of love — it's been a beautiful
                        ride.<br><br>
                        Now, after a magical proposal at the foot of Mount Fuji, we’re tying the knot in the heart of
                        Melbourne, and couldn’t be more excited to celebrate this next chapter with the people we love
                        most.<br><br>
                        Get ready for a day filled with love, laughs, plenty of music and lots of drinks!

                    <h2>Ceremony</h2>
                    <p>Our 12:00 pm ceremony will take place at the registry office at the Old Treasury Building, right
                        in the center of Melbourne. It’s a stunning building that dates back to 1858, built during the
                        gold rush. Not only is it beautiful, but it holds a lot of history, and it feels like the
                        perfect spot for us to begin this new chapter. <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, the registry office doesn't have a lot of space, so we are only able to invite
                        our close family into the building for the ceremony - which will last about 30 minutes.</p>

                    <h2>Reception</h2>
                    <p>Kicking off at 2:00 pm at the House of Plants Bar in Abbotsford. It’s got that classic Melbourne
                        vibe, plants everywhere, great cocktails, and a relaxed atmosphere. We will have some live music
                        being played throughout the day that captures our cultural backgrounds and provides a great
                        backdrop for the delicious food we will have catered from local Melbourne
                        establishments.<br><br>
                        Unfortunately, as the reception venue is a bar, we are unable to invite along any children -
                        apologies for any difficulty this causes!</p>

                    <h2>Dress code</h2>
                    <p>For us, the most important thing is having you there to share this special moment. So wear
                        whatever makes you feel good. That said, if you're wondering what to pack, December in Melbourne
                        can be hot and dry, or cold and windy, or all four seasons in a day, so bring some sunnies,
                        maybe a light coat, and keep an eye on the weather apps as the day gets closer.</p>
                    <h2>Wedding Week Celebrations</h2>
                    <p>With people travelling from overseas and interstate, we thought it would be a good opportunity to
                        have some celebrations in the days leading up to and following the wedding. Please watch this
                        space as we get nearer to December!</p>
                    <h2>Wishing Well</h2>
                    <p>While we are not expecting gifts from our guests, we will have a wishing well at the reception.
                        We understand that many of our guests are travelling to Melbourne, and it is an expensive city
                        to visit, so just having you there to celebrate the day with us is our gift.</p>

    <section id="Where">
        <h1 class="section-title">Where to Stay & Explore</h1>
        <p>Melbourne is one of those cities that’s best explored at your own pace. If you’ve got some free time before
            or after the wedding, here are a few spots to check out or to consider staying. All of these locations are
            easily accessible to the wedding reception. <br><br>
            If you're looking to stay somewhere that is walking distance to the wedding reception, then we would
            recommend Collingwood, Richmond, or Abbotsford. If you're looking to stay somewhere close to us, we're in
            North Melbourne. For hotels and Airbnbs, we'd recommend somewhere in the CBD or inner city, as these will
            have the most options and easy public transport. Feel free to reach out to either of us if you would like to
            bounce any ideas off us!</p>

                <h2>Melbourne CBD, Docklands & Southbank:</h2>
                <p>The heart of Melbourne is a vibrant mix of culture, shopping, and entertainment. Explore historic
                    arcades, visit the State Library, or admire world-class art at the National Gallery of Victoria.
                    Federation Square and Hosier Lane showcase the city’s creative energy, while the Queen Victoria
                    Market offers a classic local shopping experience. Docklands brings modern waterfront dining,
                    shopping, and stunning views, while Southbank’s riverside promenade is home to arts venues, lively
                    restaurants, and the Crown Entertainment Complex. For breathtaking city views, head up to the Eureka
                    Skydeck.</p>
                <h2>Inner Northern Suburbs:</h2>
                <p>Melbourne’s inner north is full of character and creativity. Fitzroy and Collingwood are hotspots for
                    street art, quirky cafes, and boutique shopping. Brunswick buzzes with live music and diverse food,
                    while Richmond blends great dining, bustling pubs, and sports culture at the MCG. North Melbourne
                    offers a quieter charm with historic streets, cafes, and easy access to Queen Victoria Market.</p>

                    to boutique shopping and the lush Royal Botanic Gardens. South Melbourne has a relaxed, village feel
                    with its famous market and heritage buildings. Prahran is known for its buzzing nightlife and Chapel
                    Street shopping, while St Kilda’s beachside charm includes Luna Park, lively cafes, and a thriving
                    music scene.</p>
                <h2>Outside Melbourne:</h2>
                <p>Beyond the city, Victoria offers stunning landscapes and charming towns. The Yarra Valley is perfect
                    for wine lovers, with rolling vineyards and scenic views. The Mornington Peninsula combines
                    beautiful beaches, wineries, and relaxing hot springs. Take a drive along the Great Ocean Road to
                    see breathtaking coastal scenery and the iconic Twelve Apostles. <br><br>
                    We hope you’ll take the time to explore and enjoy Melbourne —whether you’re relaxing in the city or
                    heading out to see some stunning spots around the state!</p>
